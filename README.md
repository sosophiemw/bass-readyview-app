# bass-readyview-app

There is code for two apps in this repository:
- The bass app uses the pyvirtualcam library to deliver colorcorrected and flipped video feed directly to Zoom making it useful for tele-mentoring
- The standalone app displays the color corrected video feed directly in the app but can not be used with Zoom
